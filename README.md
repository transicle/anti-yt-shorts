Avoid distractions by completely removing the YouTube Shorts feature from YouTube.

## Installing

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before you install anything, make sure you have an extension to run userscripts (Personally I'd recommend [Violetmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) or [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)). These kinds of extensions allow for automatically modifying any kind of website that the script you install is targeted to.
